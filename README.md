# ELTE-Vault
## Description:
If you are here, you found my personal repository for holding my Obsidian vault about my studies at **Eötvös Loránd University of Hungary**. Feel free to use any of my notes, especially if you are a fellow student of ELTE. 

The usage of this repository is recommended with **Obsidian** due to the following happening with the lack of it:
- Some of the LaTex renders not working natively.
- Broken links between notes.
-
