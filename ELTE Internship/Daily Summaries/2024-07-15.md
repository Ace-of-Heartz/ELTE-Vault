# Results:
For the most part, I spent the time integrating and debugging ImGUI into my project.
Sadly, I couldn't integrate it fully, because of various reasons, such as:
- the documentation and example projects aren't very clear for me on the usage of ImGUI in a "live" DX12 environment. This is probably because of my less experience in lower level graphic environments. 
	On the next meeting [[2024-07-17]] I am planning on asking for help on this, but right now this isn't a priority in terms of the project.
- Furthermore I reviewed [ASW Systems](https://man.fas.org/dod-101/navy/docs/es310/asw_sys/asw_sys.htm), but couldn't find many useful information that's related to the project itself, as it mainly dwelves into the types of sonar being used, and their properties/structure.
	- On the hand, if we want to continue with implementing the simulation of different sonar types into the project, this could still be useful.
# Notes:
- There was a slight confusion with my project leader, but it has been resolved on 07.16. Further details in [[2024-07-16]]
