# Results: 
- Managed to debug a linker error caused by missing dependencies:
	- DirectXShaderCompiler is needed for using DxcCreateInstance, which is available in NuGet packages
- Many debugging . . . .
# Problems:
- Shader compilation is causing some issues right now:
	- The original tutorial seems to be using a very low-level technique for compiling the shaders directly from .hlsl files
	- It's probably worth to use a more higher-level technique, because most examples seem to be using .cso files 
- UWP application registration seems to be causing issues:
	- The problem didn't really occur because of explicit reasons, it just started happening
