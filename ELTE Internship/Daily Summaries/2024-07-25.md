# Results: 
- Figured out why the shaders were not found by VS2022
	- The solution is basically you have to manually copy them to AppX
	- There might be a way to copy the original ones into AppX **which I haven't found yet**
	- TODO: SDKs need switching for the code to work, but that broke some external symbol stuff, so debugging it is!
