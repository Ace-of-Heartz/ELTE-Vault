# Results:
- Reviewed the DirectX12 wrapper and started making comments/notes for a better understanding
- [[Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) Systems]] was made, and reviewed the related article found in the note
- Finished my weekly report
- Looked into **Falcor**, but it is completely Nvidia Driver dependent
