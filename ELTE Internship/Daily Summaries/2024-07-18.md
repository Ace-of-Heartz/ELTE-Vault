# Results:
Mainly continued integrating the Axodox wrapper and a 3rd party semi-framework together (Nvidia Developer)

My observations so far are:
- The Axodox wrapper continues to be very inflexible in its usage, because:
	- Adding new files/projects isn't very smooth, as certain steps are needed which require the violation of clean code and code structuring overall
	- The above violations can introduce new bugs and difficulties in adding additional 3rd code to the project (which is needed because of the lack of DXR support from the wrapper)
	- The lack of DXR support means I have **do** have to introduce 3rd party code to the project
