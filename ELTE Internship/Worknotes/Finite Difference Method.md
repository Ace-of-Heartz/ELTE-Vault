	- "In [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis), **finite-difference methods** (**FDM**) are a class of numerical techniques for solving [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equations "Differential equations") by approximating [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") with [finite differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_approximation "Finite difference approximation"). Both the spatial domain and time domain (if applicable) are [discretized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization "Discretization"), or broken into a finite number of intervals, and the values of the solution at the end points of the intervals are approximated by solving algebraic equations containing finite differences and values from nearby points."
