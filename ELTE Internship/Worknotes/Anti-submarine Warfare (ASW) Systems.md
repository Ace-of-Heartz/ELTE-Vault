# Figure of Merit equation:
$FOM_{active}$ (reverberation-limited) = SL + TS - RL- DT
where
- SL: Source level
- RL: Reverberation level
- NL: noise level
- DI: Directivity index
- DT: ?
- TS: ?
# Active Sonar
Consists of: 
- **Transmitter**: Generates the outgoing pulse
- **Transducer array**
- **Beamforming processor**: The input/output of each transducer is put through this
- **Duplexer**: Protects the receiver from the full transmitter power while the pulse is going out.
- **Synchronizer**: Provides overall coordination and timing for the system.
- **Receiver**: Collects the received energy.
- **Display**:
- **PPI**: plan position indicator
# Passive Sonar
Consists of: 
- **Hydrophone array**
- **Beamforming processor**
- **Broadband display**

# Types of Sonar
- Sonobuoys
- Bi-static Sonar
- Towed Array Sonar Systems
- Variable Depth Sonar
