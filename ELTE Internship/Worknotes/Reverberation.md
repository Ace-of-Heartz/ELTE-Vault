**Factors** of the propagation of sound:
- Spreading
- Absorption
- Reflection
- Refraction
- Scattering

**Reverberation:** total of all scattering received at a particular rotation
**Reverberation** can be a limiting factor in the detection of the echo signal, as the reverberation can be more intense the the returning echo and the ambient noise.
# Types of Reverberation
## Volume Reverberation
- mainly caused by marine life
- degree of scattering depends on the wavelength of the sound relative to the size of the particle, particle density, particle shape
- **inhomogeneities**: fluctuations in salinity, density, temperature that cause scattering 
- decreases with increasing ocean depth
- **exception**: [[Deep Scattering Layer]]
## Sea Surface Reverberation
**Roughness**: from millimeter ripples to large storm waves
Scattering depends on:
- angle at which the sound approaches the sea surface
- wind speed
- wavelength
- presence of bubbles
Greater scattering generally occurs at smaller wavelengths and higher wind speeds.

The roughness of the underside of the ice is a significant factor affecting the reverberation.

## Bottom Reverberation
Generally more complex than the sea surface level reverberation.
Scattering depends on: 
- angle of incidence
- sound wavelength
- surface roughness
- seafloor type
- sediment layering
- grain size (although surface roughness may be a better indicator of scattering strength)
- grain size distribution

# Reverberation in Shallow Water
Generally reverberation levels tend to be higher because:
- reverberation is created throughout the water column
- generally more abundant marine life and suspended sediments
