## Radiation of Sound:
### Spherical spreading:
- Omni-directional radiation from point monopole source
- Acoustic intensity normal to the surface of the sphere at a distance $s$:
	- $I(s) = W/4\pi s^2$ 
## Keywords:
- **active sonar**: 
	- comprises a transmitter and receiver
	- works on the principle of *echolocation*
	- position of target can be estimated from the time delay and the direction of the echo
- **passive sonar**:
	- includes only a receiver
	- signal is detected by the sound emitted by the target 
- **attenuation**: 
	- process of decay in amplitude due to a combination of *absorption* and *scattering* of sound
- **scattering**:  redistribution in angle away from the original propagation direction, with no loss of acoustic energy
- **absorption**: conversion to some other form of energy
- **relaxation frequencies**: 
	- used in the representative conditions
	- $f_1 = 1.15\ kHz$
	- $f_2 = 75.6\ kHz$ 
- **audibility**: acoustical analogue of "visibility"
	- varies between $10^2 mNp^{-1}$ at $300\ kHz$ and $10^6 mNp^{-1}$ at $300\ kHz$ 
- **NP (Neper)**: [Neper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neper)

# Part II.: The Four Pillars
## Sonar Oceanography:
The following are factors which might be worth modelling for correct sonar simulation:
- **Bathymetry:**
	- Source cited by book: https://topex.ucsd.edu/WWW_html/mar_topo.html
- **Salinity:**
	- The book recommends a general value for salinity but provides maps showcasing varying levels of salinity
- **Temperature:**
	- Sources for heat maps are available online
- **Acidity:**
	- Sources for heat maps are available online
- **Viscosity:**
	-
