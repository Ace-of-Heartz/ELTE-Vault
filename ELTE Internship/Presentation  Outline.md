1. Motivation: 
	- Other projects: simwave
	- WebGPU - wgpu-py 
		- The most widely used method is the finite difference one - Numerical solutions!
		- Used for ultrasound, NDT, FWI
	- Exploring raytracing due to the sound waves having similar properties in terms of interaction with their surroundings to electromagnetic waves
2. The articles:
	- Sonar Technology
	- Soundwave Propagation
		- [[Reverberation]]
		- Scattering
			- Particles
			- Sealife
		- Types of phenomenons:
			- Shadow Zones
			- Convergence Zones
			- Sound Channels
			- The Scattering Layer
			- Shallow water
			- Seabed types and materials effect
			- Sea surface reverberation
3. The implementation:
	- A bit about raytracing and DXR:
	- The development process:
		- Relatively few sources for implement DXR in a more complex environment
		- A bit unstable due to unseen dependencies and other things in the code
	- Experimenting with multiple environments:
		- Falcor
		- FidelityFX Cauldron
		- Both seemed to be more advanced and therefore harder to use without proper time for learning things about them
1. The future:
	- Further refinement of the DXR implementation
	- Further research about sonars: book
