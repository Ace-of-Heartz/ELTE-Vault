# Current Status:
- Simulation with horizontal boundaries
# Topics & Questions:
- https://download.gebco.net/ - Normal Map + Texture 
	- Upper and lower boundary
	- Approximated Normal for Seabed 
- Use of predefined points for depth, salinity, temperature
	- Find the 2 closest points to current point
- Raytracing for boundary reflection? 
- Attenuation of Rays
- Detection of objects with Sonar -> Return of Rays
