# Improvements for Bezier-curves

## Bezier-spline
Let $m$ be the maximum degree of our Bezier-curves.
Approximate a graph/function/curve using a Bezier-spline with the following steps:
1. For the first 4 points of the Bezier-curve do the basic Bezier algorithm
2. For the 5th point ($p_{5}$), create a "new Bezier-curve" with the following considerations:
	- The curve and its derivative should be continuous at $p_{4}$.
		- We can achieve this by using an additional point between our 4th ($p_{4}$) and 5th ($p_{5}$) point: $p_{4,5}$
		- $p_{4}\ p_{4,5}$ should be parallel to $p_{3}\ p_{4}$ 
3. For the next 2 points do the basic Bezier algorithm.
4. For the next point repeat the previous steps from *2.*
